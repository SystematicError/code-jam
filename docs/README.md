### What is this?

This is the documentation for Boxed, a terminal game made for the [Python Discord Summer Code Jam 2021](https://pythondiscord.com/events/code-jams/8/). The theme for the project was **Thinking inside the box**. The project is written in Python around the [Blessed](https://pypi.org/project/blessed/) framework.

_Note: Since this project was written under a short time period, it may contain bugs. We are aware of a bug where if you enter a number under 3 for the height or width input for your game, it will return a error. This was patched in commit `895c9a8` but this commit ended up being reverted for the final submission due to it breaking another feature._
