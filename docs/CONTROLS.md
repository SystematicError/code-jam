# Controls

Boxed is a window based terminal app, so you can navigate through different menus/screens by pressing certain keys on your keyboard. Here is an exhaustive list on different keys for each menu.

_Note: These keybinds are neatly displayed in the bottom right corner of your terminal!_

### Menus

**Enter** - Select an option on a menu.

**Ctrl + C** - Forcefully exit the application.

**B** - Go back to the previous menu.

**UP, DOWN** - Toggle through the given options in a menu.

### Game

**S** - Stop the game, do not use this unless you want to loose your progress.

**Spacebar** - Twist/rotate the current cell

**H** - Shows a hint; highlights the path from the start cell to the end cell.

### Finished?

After understanding the different keybinds, read through [Game Mechanics](https://github.com/SystematicError/code-jam/tree/master/docs/GAMEPLAY.md) for total Boxed domination!
